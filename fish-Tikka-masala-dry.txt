 
Put some more oil to get curry in fish, use really finely chopped half tomatoes, and use yogurt a bit.
 
1.	Bought the Tilapia fish with paprika from Kroger. Do not buy frozen fish. We tried it but it was okay, and you have to thaw it and then marinate it.
2.	In bowl pour Oil 6-8 tablespoon of oil.
3.	 Mix two premade Indian curry powder (chicken curry and some other curry) from Indian grocery store (do not use premade fish curry powder). About 4-6 tablespoons total.
4.	1 tablespoon of each  red chili powder, fresh finely chopped ginger/ green chilies. Add small amount of turmeric (use 3 or 4 peanut size). Mix 1 spoon of coriander powder (jeeru)
5.	Do not use any garlic and onion .
6.	Let the curry (step 4) marinate by itself for 1-2 hour.  Taste and adjust the seasoning to your preference.
7.	Then marinate the curry you had made with fish. 
8.	Let the fish marinate for at least 3 hours.
9.	Cook the fish the on grill using foil paper on medium heat. Or you can cook the fish on any non-stick cooking utensils on medium heat. It should be cooked in less than 10 minutes, grill twice on each side at minimum or more for crunchiness.
 
Enjoy the meal.
